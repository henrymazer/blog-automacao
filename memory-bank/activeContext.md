## Active Decisions

### Code Organization
- Using class-based approach for core functionality
- Separate modules for different responsibilities
- Type hints for better maintainability
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Single entry point through automacao.py

### API Usage
- Encapsulated Perplexity AI interactions
- Low temperature (0.2) setting maintained
- Structured prompts for consistency
- Error handling with fallbacks
- Reference cleanup for better formatting
- Multi-stage fallback system for robustness

### Text Formatting Conventions
- Regular paragraphs have a single line break between them
- Section headers (H2/H3) have double line break before and single after
- Headers use Markdown H2 (##) and H3 (###) notation
- Images follow Markdown format: ![Alt text](path)
- No extra line break after the final paragraph
- Source links use Markdown format: [Fonte: text](url)
- Consistent verb tenses throughout
- Clear and direct language
- Standardized punctuation

## Current Considerations
1. Code Quality
   - All modules properly documented
   - Type hints for better IDE support
   - Error handling improved
   - Code reusability enhanced
   - Clear entry point established
   - Reference cleanup utilities added

2. Scalability
   - Ready for multi-state processing
   - Modular architecture supports expansion
   - Consistent interface across components
   - Error handling at all levels
   - Robust fallback mechanisms

3. Maintainability
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Well-documented classes and functions
   - Reusable formatting utilities
   - Consistent naming conventions
   - Simplified project structure
   - Enhanced source formatting

# Project Intelligence

## Project Patterns
- Project is focused on Brazilian states data analysis and article generation
- Articles are written in Portuguese
- Numbers follow Brazilian formatting standards
- All sources are cited using markdown links
- Code comments and documentation are in English

## File Organization
- Source code: automacao.py in root directory
- Memory bank: Organized documentation in memory-bank/
- Data sources: External CSV files in D:\jornalera-marista\censo-2022\dados\estados\

## Implementation Notes
- Primary focus is on Acre state as prototype
- Articles follow structured paragraph format
- API calls use low temperature for consistency
- Error handling includes graceful fallbacks

## Workflow Preferences
- Test changes with Acre state first
- Validate outputs before scaling to all states
- Keep documentation updated as features are added
- Track progress in memory-bank/progress.md

## Known Patterns
- CSV data requires specific column handling
- API responses need consistent formatting
- Numbers should use locale-specific formatting
- Historical data requires source citations
